# Dynamic News Feed with Pagination

This project is a simple dynamic news feed web application where users can add news articles and view them in a paginated grid layout.

## Features

- Add articles with a title, description, and optional image URL.
- Display articles dynamically in a grid format.
- Pagination to navigate through multiple pages (4 articles per page).
- Fully responsive and styled with CSS.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure

The page includes:
- **Article Form**: Input fields for title, description, and image URL.
- **News Feed**: A grid container that displays articles.
- **Pagination Controls**: Buttons to move between pages and select specific page numbers.

### JavaScript Logic

- Articles are stored in an array (`sampleArticles`).
- On form submission, articles are validated and added to the array.
- The display updates to show the correct articles for the current page.
- Pagination controls dynamically adjust based on the number of articles.

### Sample Articles

The project includes 12 preloaded sample articles to demonstrate pagination.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.
2. Add new articles using the form at the top.
3. Use pagination controls to browse through the article list.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css`: CSS for layout and styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for adding articles and handling pagination.
